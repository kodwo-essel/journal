    "content": "Results are out. People are picking schools. People are picking programs. And I know most of you are thinking the same way your parents are thinking, the same way everyone is thinking. Which program will get me a job? Which one is safe? Which one will actually work?\n\nI understand that feeling completely. But I want to talk about something that has been bothering me for a while now.\n\nOur educational system is teaching us things that people were learning fifteen years ago. The world has moved on. Technology has moved on. Jobs have moved on. But our schools are still in the same place. You go through four years or three years studying something, you come out, and the thing you spent all that time learning about has either disappeared or it has changed so much that you do not even recognize it. Or there are so many people doing the same thing that there is simply no space for anyone else.\n\nThis is not just about universities. It is training colleges too. These places used to be like gold. You finish secondary school, you go to a training college, you come out, and there is a job waiting. That was real. That worked. But now? Now the government cannot absorb everyone. The private sector cannot absorb everyone. And everyone is confused because the system that worked before is not working the same way anymore.\n\nSo we keep pushing people into the same programs because that is what we know. That is what we have seen work. But we are not thinking about what will happen five years from now when this person finishes school. We are not thinking about whether that job will even exist. We are not thinking about whether the whole industry might have changed by then.\n\nI had a conversation with someone I respect, and he told me something that made me think. He said people look at him strangely sometimes. Like his education was a waste. But this person has farms. He studied at university. He built a network. He learned how to think. And now he is using all of that in his business. But people do not see it that way. They think education is supposed to lead to one thing and one thing only. A job in an office somewhere. That is such a limited way of thinking.\n\nThe truth is that the gap between what we are learning and what the world actually needs has become very wide. Very wide. And while we wait for the system to fix itself, we cannot just sit and do nothing. We cannot afford to. We have to be smart about this.\n\nSo when you are picking a program, or when you are helping someone else pick one, think about it differently. Think about what will be relevant in five or ten years. Think about what skills matter. Think about what the world will actually need. Because the jobs you see right now might not be there when you graduate.\n\nBut here is the thing. You do not have to wait for a job to come to you. Whatever you study, you can do something with it. You studied chemistry? You can start a food processing business. You can preserve food. You can go into agriculture properly. You studied engineering? There are things that need to be built. There are businesses waiting to happen. You studied food science? Start a business with it. Whatever you are learning, there is a way to use it. You just have to see it.\n\nI studied something that is very respected. And yes, It is a very good field to be. But I looked around at what was happening. I learned other things. I paid attention. And I moved into something else. One of my greatest assets is being willing to change. Being willing to learn. Being willing to look at the world and say okay, what actually makes sense right now?\n\nSo whether you are in school already or you are about to go, do not just accept what you are given. Learn beyond the classroom. Pay attention to what is changing. Pick up skills that matter. Do not wait for someone to create a job for you. Think about how you can create opportunities for yourself.\n\nAnd look, I am not saying our schools are perfect. They need to do better. The system needs to catch up. But we cannot wait for that to happen. We can either sit and complain, or we can find our way around the problem. We can take charge of our own future.\n\nSo my advice is simple. Whether it is for your child or your younger sibling or your friend, think long term. Do not push them into something just because it sounds impressive or because it worked for someone else. Ask real questions. Look at what is coming. Help them understand what they are actually good at. Then match that with what you think the world will need.\n\nThat is how you make a decision that actually matters. That is how you prepare yourself properly. And that is the only advice worth giving.",

    "excerpt": "What kills a man is not always his crime, but his unbelief and pride.",
    "content": "A king so hated crime that he made a decree.\nWhoever commits a crime will pay a hefty fine.\nA fine greater than a lifetime’s wages or be killed.\n\nTime went by and people were dying because not only were they unable to stay away from crime, they were also unable to pay.\nAnd because a king cannot go back on his words, they had to be killed.\n\nThe king began to feel pity for the people and asked his son.\n“What can we now do?”\n\nOne day his son went to his father and said:\n“Father, all your properties are my inheritance. By extension, all the land is mine too.\nFor the next N years, whoever commits a crime and runs to me, I will pay their fine.”\n\nThe father agreed and said, “Accepted. But N will remain unknown even to you. I alone will know what N is.”\n\nAnd so it happened.\n\nKofi committed a crime and ran to the prince.\n“Oh Prince, save me.”\n\nThe prince went to his father’s inheritance, which was also his.\nHe took the money and paid his father on Kofi’s behalf.\n\nKofi’s fine was paid.\nThe money went back to the king.\nAnd by extension, to the prince.\n\nNo one lost money.\nThe king did not go back on his word.\nAnd Kofi was saved.\n\nThe prince then told Kofi:\n“Go and tell the people in the town that whoever has committed a crime should come to me and they will be saved.”\n\nKofi went to his friends, Kojo and Asantewaa.\n\nAsantewaa ran to the prince.\nBut Kojo did not.\n\nKojo said:\n“But I see you commit crimes sometimes too.”\n\nYes, Kofi committed crimes sometimes.\nBut he quickly ran to the prince and was saved.\n\nKojo refused.\nHe believed he could live perfectly before the king.\nHe believed he would never commit a crime.\n\nOne day, the N years elapsed.\n\nKojo begged for mercy.\nBut it was already too late.\n\nKojo was killed.\n\nWhat killed Kojo?\n\nIt was not his crimes.\nIt was his unbelief.\nIt was his pride.\n\nHe thought he could live perfectly before the king.\nThat arrogance and unbelief were what killed him.\n\nDo not be like Kojo.\n\nYou will not go to hell because of your sins.\nYou will go because of your unbelief and pride.\n\nJesus is knocking at your door.",
